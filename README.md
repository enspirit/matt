# Matt - A monitoring tool for data-driven business decisions

Matt is a CTO-oriented tool that helps capturing daily data points that are
relevant for conducting growth hacking and other data-driven decisions.

It consists of the following abstractions:

* Datasource: provides access to data from which measures are extracted
* Measure: standardized data vector for relevant decisions
* Exporter: a way to save measures for future analysis and visualization
